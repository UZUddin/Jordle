# Jordle

Jordle is a JavaFX-based desktop application developed as part of **CS 1331: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming**.

The goal of this project was to practice object-oriented design in Java while learning to build graphical user interfaces using **JavaFX**, by recreating a simplified version of the game **Wordle**.
